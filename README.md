# Python Data Handling Basics

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental data manipulation and analysis techniques using Python. A real-world student performance dataset was processed using NumPy and Pandas, and insights were visualized using Matplotlib.

## Dataset
- Name: AllResults.csv
- Description: Student academic performance data including estimated and actual scores.
- Rows: 1037
- Columns: 20

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Manipulation Techniques Used
- Loading CSV data using Pandas
- Exploring data using head(), info(), describe()
- Handling missing values using mean and placeholders
- Data slicing and column selection
- Conditional filtering of rows
- Creating new features using lambda functions
- Using map(), filter(), and zip()
- Aggregation and basic statistics

## Analysis Performed
- Calculated average performance scores
- Categorized students into High, Medium, and Low performers
- Identified top-performing students based on conditions
- Visualized performance distribution using bar charts and histograms

## Visualizations
- Performance Level Distribution
- Average Score Distribution

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of DataFrames and arrays
- Practical experience with data cleaning
- Hands-on use of functional programming concepts
- Basic data visualization skills
